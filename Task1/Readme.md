# ðŸŽ¬ Codsoft Movie Genre Classification


This project focuses on predicting movie genres using machine learning techniques based on textual data analysis.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting a movie's genre based on its plot summary or textual information. Natural language processing techniques like TF-IDF and classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are utilized for this purpose.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb). It contains movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres.

## Techniques Used

- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopwords removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
