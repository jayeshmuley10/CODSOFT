In the realm of business, ChurnMaster stands as the sentinel against customer attrition. This project focuses on predicting customer churn for subscription-based services using the powers of machine learning.

## Introduction

ChurnMaster, the custodian of customer relationships, endeavors to predict customer churn for subscription-based businesses. Leveraging historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics, algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and the formidable Gradient Boosting will be summoned to forecast churn.

## Dataset

The dataset empowering this endeavor resides [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction). It encapsulates a wealth of historical customer data, encompassing usage behavior, demographics, and the crucial churn indicators.
