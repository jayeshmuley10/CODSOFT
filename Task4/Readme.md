In the realm of communication, SMS Guardian stands vigilant against the whispers of deceit. This project delves into building an AI model capable of distinguishing between genuine messages and spam.

## Introduction

SMS Guardian's mission is to shield the sanctity of SMS communication by predicting whether a message is spam or legitimate. Leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings paired with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or the robust Support Vector Machines (SVM) will unravel the veil of spam messages.

## Dataset

The dataset essential to empower our quest is nestled [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). It contains a trove of SMS messages, encapsulating both legitimate and spam texts.

### A Sneak Peek into the Archives

| SMS ID | Message Content | Classification |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 001    | "Free discount! Claim now!" | Spam |
| 002    | "Meeting at 2 PM today." | Legitimate |
| ...    | ... | ... |

## Techniques Wielded

- **Textual Wizardry:** Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings will decode the textual essence of messages.
- **Guardian Classifiers:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and the stalwart Support Vector Machines (SVM) shall discern the deceitful from the authentic.
