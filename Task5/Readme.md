![Text Generation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Text%20Generation-Enabled-blue) 

In the realm of text, the Handwritten Text Scribe emerges, ready to craft new narratives through the mystical powers of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This project focuses on training an RNN model to generate handwritten-like text based on learned patterns.

## Introduction
 
The Handwritten Text Scribe seeks to emulate the artistry of handwritten text using the arcane knowledge of character-level recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Trained on a dataset of handwritten text examples, this scribe is capable of weaving new text based on the learned patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset fueling our creative endeavors resides in these scrolls:
- [Dataset 1](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/deepwriting)
- [Dataset 2](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/iam)
- [Dataset 3](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/hkr)

These scrolls contain a treasury of handwritten text examples, serving as the foundation for our scribe's education.

## Techniques Wielded

- **Neural Scribal Arts:** Implementing character-level RNNs to learn the intricacies of handwritten text patterns.
- **Training the Scribe:** Fostering the scribe's skills through the dataset's tutelage to generate novel handwritten-like text.
