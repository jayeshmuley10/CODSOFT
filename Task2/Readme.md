Guarding the realms of finance! This project is dedicated to detecting fraudulent credit card transactions through the power of machine learning.

## Introduction

In the domain of financial security, FraudShield is the stalwart defender against deceitful credit card activities. The mission: build an impervious machine learning model capable of discerning fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. Techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and the enigmatic Random Forests will be summoned in this quest.

## Dataset

The dataset for this noble endeavor can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection). It holds crucial information about credit card transactions, including indicators of fraudulence.

### A Sneak Peek into the Ledger
